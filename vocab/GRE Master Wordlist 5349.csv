[blatant versus flagrant]	Blatant refers to anything that is offensive, notorious, or shocking, especially in an obvious or conspicuous way. Something that is blatant is often obtrusive in a crass manner - and blatant can be used of persons and things. Flagrant refers to anything that is evil or wrong, a willful or glaring violation of a promise or flouting of law or morality. A flagrant offense or error is so bad that it cannot escape notice. Flagrant is definitely the stronger term. Blatant was purportedly created by the English poet Spenser; flagrant derives from an Aryan word meaning 'to blaze' and its original meaning was 'blazing, burning, flaming'. Examples are: He blatantly lied about having permission to leave the school. / It was a flagrant violation of human rights.
